Sundown dazzling day
Gold through my eyes
But my eyes turned within only see

Starless and bible black

Old friend charity
Cruel twisted smile
And the smile signals emptiness for me

Starless and bible black

Ice blue silver sky
Fades into grey
To a grey hope that all yearns to be

Starless and bible black
